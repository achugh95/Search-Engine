# Search-Engine

A HTTP service that provides an endpoint for fuzzy search /
autocomplete of English words.

Given a dataset that contains 333,333 English words and the frequency of their usage in
some corpus. A very small sample is shown below:

track 112385243<br>
australia 112197265 <br>
discussion 111973466 <br>
archive 111971865 <br>
once 111882023 <br>
others 111397714 <br>
entertainment 111394818 <br>
agreement 111356320 <br>
format 111279626 <br>

A web app where the user types in a single word from this list in a search box. We wish to autocomplete the input in the search box.

The objective is to write a Python app using Django framework that exposes a single endpoint:

`GET /search?word=&lt;input&gt;`

where input is the (partial) word that the user has typed so far. For example, if the user is looking
up procrastination, the service might receive this sequence of requests:

`GET /search?word=pro`

`GET /search?word=procr`

`GET /search?word=procra`

The response should be a JSON array containing upto 25 results, ranked by some criteria (see
below).

### Constraints
1. Matches can occur anywhere in the string, not just at the beginning. For example, eryx
should match archaeopteryx (among others).
2. The ranking of results should satisfy the following:
   
    a. We assume that the user is typing the beginning of the word. Thus, matches at the
start of a word should be ranked higher. For example, for the input pract, the result
practical should be ranked higher than impractical.
    
    b. Common words (those with a higher usage count) should rank higher than rare
words.
    
    c. Short words should rank higher than long words. For example, given the input
environ, the result environment should rank higher than environmentalism.
   
    - As a corollary to the above, an exact match should always be ranked as the
first result.

3. The search algorithm you develop should ideally incorporate some form of a weighted
average of all qualifying parameters. The perfect weights, in production systems, are
however derived through the use of ML algorithms.

### Prerequisites

Please run the following command as a pre-requisite:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
